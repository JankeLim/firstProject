<p>With e-books being so popular, it's hard to imagine that some weirdo will want to buy a physical copy. I mean, who in their right mind will do that? It takes space, gets in the way, gets dusty and crusty...the list can go on and on. It's obivious that e-books are more pratical and better that physical books. Now, with that out of the way, I'll like to say one more thing that will clear your current confusion. That 'weirdo' we talked about ealier? That's me. I'm that weirdo that wants to buy the physical copy even though I have a perfectly fine e-book of it. Now that I have explained my point and broken your trust in me, we can continue. These are the books I have had on my wish list for a long time. So long actually, that I feel they deserve the importance of being presented to you. Thank you :)</p>

	<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dont-Look-Back-Getting-Unstuck/dp/1400226570/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3PR8VV94BBXK7&keywords=don%27t+look+back+by+christine+caine&qid=1689757821&s=books&sprefix=don%27t+look+%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C472&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Don't Look Back</a> by Christine Caine</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are times in life when we look back and feel desperate to make time stand still, particularly when we get blindsided by unexpected changes. But we can't stop the flow of life, and we can't stop time. What's more, looking back doesn't enable us to go back. More often than not, it just makes us stuck. In a place. In a space. In a memory. In a mindset. In a habit.
In Luke 17:32, Jesus drops three little words: "Remember Lot's wife." We don't know her name, history, or story. All we know is that when she was fleeing Sodom and Gomorrah, she was told not to look back, and she did the one thing she was asked not to do. She looked back and turned into a pillar of salt. And out of the 170 women referred to in the Scriptures, she's the only one Jesus told us to remember.
With a rallying cry to "Remember Lot's wife," Bible teacher, international speaker, activist, and bestselling author Christine Caine motivates us to stop looking back, to get unstuck and to keep moving forward into God's promises and purpose for our lives.
We may not know all God's plans for us. We may not know where we are going, how long it will take us, or what we will encounter along the way, but with the strategies Christine Caine gives, we can move on from where we are to where God wants us to be.</li>
Jesus is beckoning us onward into the newness of what lies ahead. Stop disqualifying yourself by getting stuck in the past. It's time to remember Lot's wife and not look back but move forward boldly.

<ul>
<li>Maybe it was a grandparent, or a teacher, or a colleague. Someone older, patient and wise, who understood you when you were young and searching, helped you see the world as a more profound place, gave you sound advice to help you make your way through it. For Mitch Albom, that person was his college professor Morrie Schwartz.
Maybe, like Mitch, you lost track of this mentor as you made your way, and the insights faded, and the world seemed colder. Wouldn't you like to see that person again, ask the bigger questions that still haunt you, receive wisdom for your busy life today the way you once did when you were younger?
Mitch Albom had that second chance. He rediscovered Morrie in the last months of the older man's life. Knowing he was dying, Morrie visited with Mitch in his study every Tuesday, just as they used to back in college. Their rekindled relationship turned into one final "class": lessons in how to live. "The truth is, Mitch,"" he said, "once you learn how to die, you learn how to live."
Tuesdays with Morrie is a magical chronicle of their time together, through which Mitch shares Morrie's lasting gift with the world.</li>

<ul>
<li>Discovered in the attic where she spent the last years of her life, Anne Frank's remarkable diary has become a world classic-a powerful reminder of the horrors of war and an eloquent testament to the human spirit.
In 1942, as Nazis occupied Holland, a thirteen-year-old Jewish girl and her family fled their home in Amsterdam and went into hiding. For the next two years, until their whereabouts were betrayed to the Gestapo, they and another family lived cloistered in the secret upstairs rooms of an old office building. Cut off from the outside world, they faced hunger, boredom, the constant cruelties of living in confined quarters, and the ever-present threat of discovery and death.
In her diary Anne Frank recorded vivid impressions of her experiences during this period. By turns thoughtful, moving, and amusing, Anne's account offers a fascinating commentary on human courage and frailty and a compelling self-portrait of a sensitive and spirited young woman whose promise was tragically cut short.</li>

	<h3><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Night-Elie-Wiesel/dp/0374500010/ref=sr_1_1?crid=PG3VNBH7V8E1&keywords=night+elie+wiesel&qid=1689761352&s=books&sprefix=night%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C461&sr=1-1" target="_blank">Night</a> by Elie Wiesel</h3>
<ul>
<li>Night is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Wiesel, Elie's wife and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language and spirit truest to the author's original intent. And in a substantive new preface, Elie reflects on the enduring importance of Night and his lifelong, passionate dedication to ensuring that the world never forgets man's capacity for inhumanity to man.
Night offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.</li>
